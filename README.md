## 🤔What is This

Have you ever tried to **find out who was absent from a meeting** or activity by looking through name list one by one? 

Names are typically not ordered, which means it is really boring to match the one in two list.

Now with this wonderful tool you can escape from this horrible work and handle it to computer!

## 🚀How to Use

Go to [Find Who Absent (taylorandtony.github.io)](https://taylorandtony.github.io/find-who-absent/) and **fill in 2 name lists**, one is all the person who *should* attend the meeting, the other is all the person who *really* present at the meeting.

This website will **automatically find who was absent** from the meeting! 😁
